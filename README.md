# Project Title

A Steel Drum/Pan MIDI controller using the Pi Pico.

## Description

A MIDI controler to create a steelpan MIDI controller that was easy
and accessable. Because of this goal it lacks various features like
velocity sensitivity.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

You will need to build some sort of controller. The one I used consist of
* Mallets with a metal head (I used a ball of foil) that connect to the ground of the pico
* A sheet of cardboard with pads of foil, of which each is connected to one of the GPIO pins

### Installing

* Copy the uf2 file to the pi pico when it is in boot mode
